I'm Wilfried, a software developer with a few years under my belt, constantly learning. I've started my professional career coding and developing software for embedded systems, slowly but constantly shifting focus towards tooling. Recently I've dabbled in distributed systems, getting to know a completely different kind of constraints. Measuring byte-seconds, reducing latency, and bumping against the good old process quite a bit. Now I enjoy being back in tooling again, where I leverage looking at problems from different perspectives.

These are my private pages about git, the version control system, and SmartGit, the git client I use the most and - full disclosure - recently been working on as well.

These pages are about git features I really like, sometimes with their respective counterparts in SmartGit, but also about features in SmartGit which not always have an easy-to-use counterpart in the git CLI. Some tales might be more about version control, or even software development practices in general, than git in particular. And then there might just be the occasional vent as well.

The source of these pages is in [git-tales](https://github.com/wnesensohn/git-tales) - feel free to open PRs or write me a message.
