## 02 - Do You Even Split?

I'm working on a feature, nothing out of the ordinary, when suddenly I come across a glaring violation of all that is holy, _a newline where no newline should go_ in some code far, far away. Being no barbarian, I do what must be done in such a situation: Getting rid of the newline, it's not like there are other options. But attention, although being all you need apparently, is not one of my strong suits, so I quickly forget about the newline and proceed with my feature.
_Of course_ it gets committed with the other changes. I'm no machine, and even if I was, Rube Goldberg would be my mother. Luckily git does not like to forget, so there comes the time when I go through the commits and detect this totally unrelated change. You may think such matters not, but imagine: You're reading a novel about a king and his castle, and just as the intruders are knocking at the door and the story really picks up its pace, have you ever thought about making holiday on the Caribbean islands? Order now, and get one day for free on caribbean-holidays-now.com.
You might not care, but for the reviewer it ruins the immersion. It takes attention away from where it should rather be, and attention is a precious good.
Do your reviewer (or your future self) a favour. Split away the change, move the commit to another branch, clean up the history, be golden. Use whatever tool you like, but make the change, no excuses. And maybe think about making that trip anyway.
